// Differential equations describing populations in an apartment building of 500 people infested by zombies:
// dS/dt = - BSZ - ESK
// dK/dt = - CKZ + ESK
// dZ/dt = BSZ + CKZ - AKZ

// Want to numerically solve the set of ODEs for several values of Z0 to determine the number of Z0 above which
// the zombies will win. 
// Outputs a netcdf file that contains (S, K, Z) population vs. time for two values of the initial Z0 values:
// one in which the zombies win (everyone is zombies), and one in which they all disappear (Z<1).
